As we can see from the results, the intercept, vehicle length, and ground clearance provide non-random amounts of variance. This is due to variable on non-random variables usually being close to 0. Given our very small p-value, at any level of significance, specifically at a 0.05 level, we can reject the null. In a linear regression, by rejecting the null, we are saying that the slope is not 0. This means that we have enough evidence to suggest that there is a significant relationship between mpg and the other variables. Given our adjusted r-square of almost 0.7, the model fits the data pretty well so it is fair to say that the model predicts prototypes somewhat efficiently.
